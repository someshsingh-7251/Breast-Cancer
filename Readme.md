# Breast Cancer Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting breast cancer diagnoses based on clinical data. The objective is to use various machine learning algorithms to classify breast tumors as either benign or malignant, helping with early diagnosis and improving patient outcomes.

## Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide. Early detection through machine learning can improve treatment outcomes and save lives. This project leverages clinical data to build predictive models for breast cancer diagnosis.

The workflow includes:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Building, training, and evaluating machine learning models.
4. Comparing the performance of different classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).

## Data
The dataset used in this project is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set**. It includes features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. Features describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

- **Columns**:
    - ID number
    - Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
    - 30 numeric features describing cell characteristics.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `jupyter`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/someshsingh-7251/Breast-Cancer.git
    cd Breast-Cancer
    ```

2. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook (if required):
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Usage
After setting up the environment, you can explore the notebooks in the repository to see how data preprocessing, EDA, and machine learning modeling were conducted.

- Open `Breast_Cancer_Prediction.ipynb` for an interactive session.
- The notebook guides you through loading the dataset, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation.

To train the models:
1. Load the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (e.g., scaling, encoding).
3. Train multiple classifiers such as:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Random Forest
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

4. Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the machine learning models is evaluated using several metrics:
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: The number of true positive results divided by the number of positive results predicted by the classifier.
- **Recall**: The number of true positive results divided by the number of actual positive cases.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC**: AUC-ROC curve to evaluate the performance of classifiers.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
